This is the website for the rock music band Olympians. Here you can find information and words about the rock music band Olympians. The rock music band Olympians have been a band for about 7/8 years or something now despite almost complete indifference both outside and within the band. They have some music to listen to on <a href='https://olympians.bandcamp.com/' target='_blank'>Bandcamp</a> and a record for sale <a href='http://barelyregalrecords.bigcartel.com/product/brr039-olympians-reasons-to-be-tearful' target='_blank'>here</a>. They have a mailing list which they have been trying to make everybody leave for about 3 years now. You can join it <a href='http://eepurl.com/gCXyX' target='_blank'>here</a>, but that's hardly the point.</p> <img class='image' src='img/olympians-milano.jpg' style='width: 100%; max-width: 620px;'><p>This is a photo of the band taken last year in Milan, which is a nice place.</p><p>Here are some videos that somewhat explain how we ended up here, and hopefully, what we're going to do about it.</p></div> <div class='video'> <h3>Simple Things</h3> <iframe width='620' height='337' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wwUi77bAmSU' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class='intro'> <p>This video was made by our good friend and general champion Marcantonio from the excellent rock music band Dags! We filmed it in DIY Space For London which is a nice place you should visit.</p> </div> <div class='video'> <h3>Smaller Shards</h3> <iframe width='620' height='337' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/et7E-anVuzg?rel=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class='intro'> <p>This video was made by our own Michael Parkin. Animation takes a long time apparently, so he had a fairly miserable time making it.</p> </div> <div class='video'> <h3>Dags/Olympians France + Spain Tour 2016</h3> <iframe width='620' height='337' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWp8NwzV8ZY?rel=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class='intro'> <p>If you haven't listened to the Italian rock music band Dags, then please go and do that now. Assuming you have now done so and are back for more facts, we have toured with them a few times and it was pretty great and they made some nice content about and were kind enough to leave out the bits where we were arguing with one another because we were old and tired of all this shit.</p> </div> <div class='video'> <h3>Reasons to be Tearful (album trailer)</h3> <iframe width='620' height='337' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3OU1d--Oyc?rel=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class='intro'> <p>Occasionally we get ideas above our station about being artistic in some fashion other than lumpenly throwing together our songs, and this well meaning but ultimately meaningless trailer for our album is an excellent example of this.</p> </div> <div class='video'> <h3>Dance Like Everybody's Watching And They Hate You</h3> <iframe width='620' height='337' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/-f-NYCAqFuY?rel=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class='intro'> <p>This is like the video above, but for the EP before that, and again is somewhat pointless.</p> </div> <div class='video'> <h3>Home Is Where Your Heart Breaks (live)</h3> <iframe class='photo' width='620' height='337' src='//player.vimeo.com/video/36643923?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class='intro'> <p>I like this one. It is nice. It was the first thing we released through Barely Regal Records, who are still yet to succeed in shaking us off.</p> </div> <div class='video'> <h3>Foreign Language</h3> <iframe class='photo' width='620' height='337' src='//player.vimeo.com/video/36170856?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class='intro'> <p>People like this song so we try not to play it too often to remind them that we do this for us, not for them.</p> </div> <div class='intro'> <p>You can also find Olympians on <a href='https://twitter.com/onwardolympians'>Twitter</a>, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/onwardolympians'>Facebook</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYouPP4orDjYxGPfr5vXq0Q'>YouTube</a> but please don't.</p> </div> </div> </body> </html>
